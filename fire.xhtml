            In my head I hear a million conversations
            I'm spinning out, don't wake me up until the end
            The rivers flowing in denial I can't fake it
            I'm paranoid that all my thoughts are all my friends
    
            I got
            Blood in my chest
            Fight in my step
            No sleep no rest
            No sleep no rest
            Sparks in my brain
            Am I insane
            Trying to light the flame
            Trying to light it
    
            All these thoughts I battle creeping up my skin, creeping up my skin
            Fears they try to rattle who I am within, where do I begin
            It's one of those days, my world is crashing everything looks on fire
            It's one of those nights, I'm dreaming but I'm walking on a wire
            All these thoughts I battle creepin up my skin, burn em from within like...
            Fire
            Fire
    
            Run away, I'm going faster if I want to
            On a journey, on a mission, never left
            No more doubt, no more running from the half truth
            I'm a fighter, lighting fires, knock em dead got
    
            I got
            Blood in my chest
            Fight in my step
            No sleep no rest
            No sleep no rest
            Sparks in my brain
            Am I insane
            Trying to light the flame
            Trying to light it
    
            All these thoughts I battle creeping up my skin, creeping up my skin
            Fears they try to rattle who I am within, where do I begin
            It's one of those days, my world is crashing everything looks on fire
            It's one of those nights, I'm dreaming but I'm walking on a wire
            All these thoughts I battle creepin up my skin, burn em from within like...
            Fire
            Let it rain let it rain
            Through the pain through the pain like...
            Fire
            Let it rain let it rain
            Through the pain through the pain like
    
            Clench my teeth, I need to end this conservation
            Strike a match cause now it's time to hit reset
            No more doubt, no more running from the half truth
            I'm a fighter, lighting fires, knock em dead
